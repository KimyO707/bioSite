      <h1>Miguel Orozco</h1>
    
      <p><span class="highlight">Hardworking</span>, <span class="highlight">determined</span>, and <span class="highlight">family-focused</span>. Miguel Orozco is one of the hardest working people you’ll ever meet.</p>
    
      <p>He came to the U.S. from a small town in Mexico when he was just 15. He didn’t speak any English and had to start working right away, doing whatever jobs he could find. While other kids were in school, he was working in tough places like a meat processing plant, doing really physically demanding stuff even though he was still just a kid. It wasn’t easy at all, but he kept going.</p>
    
      <p>Even though he didn’t have a chance to finish school here, he taught himself how to use computers just by being curious and figuring things out on his own. No classes, no degree, just trial and error and a lot of patience. That eventually helped him land a job with the Department of Health and Human Services. It’s a big change from the kind of jobs he used to do, and it just shows how determined he is.</p>
    
      <p>Through everything, his biggest motivation has always been his family. He always says he worked hard so his kids wouldn’t have to go through the same struggles. He’s the kind of dad who pushes you to do your best but is also super supportive and proud of everything you do. He’s talked about how he and my mom had nights where they couldn’t afford to eat, but they kept going anyway because they wanted a better future for us.</p>
    
      <p>He doesn’t care about being rich or having fancy stuff. He says success to him just means being happy, having food on the table, and seeing his kids grow up into good people. That’s what matters most to him. And honestly, I think that’s what makes him such an amazing dad. He’s strong, humble, smart, and always there when it counts. His story is one of hard work, sacrifice, and love. I’m super proud to call him my dad.</p>
